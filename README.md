# Brazilian
Portuguese Brazilian Language Pack for e107 v2.1.7 or higher
See v2.3.0 zip file either!

We need to set more 2 files: 
e107_admin/lancheck.php (fixed by Cameron)
e107_handlers/language_class.php (fixed by Cameron)
to fix bugs in "Brazilian" detection of files inside folders and to translate plugins inside admin language tools (Multiple Languages Core Editor)
